# Multithreaded Renderers in C & Rust -- Slides

This repository contains the raw files for the talk I gave at Confluent on Wednesday, October 4th, 2017 (10/4/17) on the two multithreaded renderers I wrote in C and Rust.

I presented these slides using [a Python web app I wrote to present slides.](https://github.com/lelandbatey/flask_slides)
